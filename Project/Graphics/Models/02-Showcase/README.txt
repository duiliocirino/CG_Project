The boat is meant to be a model to be shown on the pedestal, possibly sort of floating since the pedestal is sci-fi-looking.
You can use the diffuse texture for the boat, the other textures are for PBR. Use them only if you feel adventurous enough to implement that too.
You won't lose points if you don't implement PBR.
As for the room, you are free to build a room stretching cubes for the walls so that if best fits what you need.
